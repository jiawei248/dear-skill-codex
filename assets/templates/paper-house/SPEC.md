# paper-house — Template Spec

This document is the source-of-truth for how an agent produces a `paper-house` gift. Read it end-to-end before running the build. The design principle behind every rule: **preserve the template's visual identity; personalize the content on top.**

---

## 0. What This Template Is

A WebGL scroll-through diorama of **four small rooms that share a central corner**. The whole scene renders in Three.js inside a single HTML file. Each room has:

- An eyebrow date/kicker, a title, and a narrator-voice `note`
- A 30-second Apple Music preview that loops inside that room
- Two long undulating "wave" sentences of lyric-prose at the top of the room
- ~22-28 short phrases that fall like confetti from the wave band
- Flat wall & floor textures clothing the left wall, right wall, and floor
- A figure sprite (1 or 2) showing the protagonists inside the room
- 5-7 decoration stickers placed in 3D coordinates inside the quadrant
- Exactly ONE clickable hero sticker that opens a handwritten memory card

Four hero cards unlock across the four rooms. Each card is a warm hand-made memory note written to the recipient, wrapped in a generated photo-collage of the hero object with the protagonists.

The canonical output is `template-source/night-four-the-turn.html`. Open it in a browser when you want to see what "good" looks like.

## 1. The 8 Production Rules

### Rule 1 — Visual identity is fixed; content is personal

On every gift, these are the same:

- Room geometry, camera paths, snap angles
- Wavy lyric layout logic, falling-word particle system
- Font stack, card layout families (`layout-note` / `layout-split` / `layout-diagonal` / `layout-triangle`)
- Background particle sky (warm drifting starfield)
- Interaction model (click a hero sticker → card opens)
- The existence of exactly 4 rooms that share 1 corner

On every gift, these are **re-made from scratch for the recipient**:

- Wall textures (2 per room), floor texture (1 per room) — AI-generated per gift
- Decoration stickers (5-7 per room) — chosen from the bundled library
- Character figure art (1-2 per room) — AI-generated or processed from user photos
- Song per room — looked up via iTunes Search API
- Two lyric-prose sentences per room — AI-composed using user memories + song phrase quote
- Falling words per room — AI-derived from user memories
- Hero sticker pick — one per room, chosen to anchor a real memory
- Story-card images (1 per room) — AI-generated identity-preserving composites
- Memory card text, title, kicker, paper color, accent color, decal picks

> If the user's intake material is thin, the gift should STILL personalize everything above. Thin material means smaller, more specific anchors — not generic filler. See `references/gifting-ethics.md` § "What to do with sparse material".

### Rule 2 — Physical correctness of AI-generated images

Walls and floor:
- A wall texture shows ONLY what is painted-or-hung on that wall surface. **No receding perspective into a deep room.** The 3D engine already supplies perspective; the texture must be flat content.
- 3D detail painted onto the wall — a window frame with carved depth, a picture in a frame, a hanging lamp, a clock, a wall shelf — is welcome. What's not welcome: "a room that recedes into the distance."
- Left-wall and right-wall of one room MUST read as the same room: identical lighting direction, identical palette, identical era, identical material style. Generate them in one consistent-group pass.
- Floor is viewed top-down; it usually tiles or reads as a continuous ground plane.

Character figures (when AI-generated to supplement or replace user photos):
- If the user gave reference photo(s), the generated figure MUST preserve recognizable identity: face structure, hair, skin tone, clothing style. Not "a person" — "this person".
- Across 4 rooms the protagonist(s) must read as the SAME people: matching body proportions, consistent clothing palette, continuous wardrobe.
- When adding user photos directly (not generated), run them through `scripts/stylize-character.sh` (cutout + white outline, keep only the core person).

Story cards (the images inside memory popups):
- The hero object must be rendered correctly with attachments. **Common physics errors to avoid**:
  - A fridge door floating without hinge contact with the fridge body.
  - A chess board with missing grid rows or non-square cells.
  - A suitcase with wheels on the wrong side or missing a handle.
  - A photo frame whose inner content is empty or shows only the cardboard back.
- The protagonist(s) must be visible, recognizably the same identity as in the room figure, doing a specific micro-activity with the hero object.
- Palette and lighting must match the room's color palette (see `ROOMS[scene].palette` in the canonical HTML).
- Leave ~25% clean blank space in a predictable region (right edge, lower right, etc.) for the handwritten Chinese text overlay that the HTML layer adds.

### Rule 3 — Lyric layout aesthetics

The two long sentence lines and the falling-word confetti are the most visible typography in the whole gift. They must feel handwritten-on-a-wave, never typeset-on-a-grid.

Font and size:
- Both sentence lines and all falling words use the **same font family and same base size**.
- Glow intensity (text-shadow blur + alpha) is identical across the sentence and the falling words. No exception.

Baseline undulation:
- Each sentence is laid out along a gentle wave. The MIDDLE of the sentence (near the center of the room-facing banner) should be **closer to horizontal** — subtler rise/fall.
- The LEFT and RIGHT EDGES of the sentence should have more pronounced undulation.
- Keep the maximum vertical deviation bounded — this is a shallow wave, not a sine curve at amplitude 1.

Horizontal layout:
- Character horizontal positions must be slightly varied (jittered by a few pixels each). Never evenly spaced.
- Left-right symmetry is NOT required — the line should feel layered and asymmetric, not centered like a banner.

Falling words (the confetti):
- Each word is a **complete meaningful short phrase**, usually 1-4 words in English or 2-6 CJK characters when the user's language is Chinese. Never a broken chunk of a longer thought ("chopping vegetables" is good; "chopping veget" is forbidden).
- Roughly 60% of the words must be concrete specifics drawn from the user's memories ("tomato steam", "you turned back", "passed the bowl"). Roughly 40% can be general mood tokens ("soft for a long time", "a little closer").
- Rotation per word: **random angle in [-20°, +20°]**. Never 0°. Never beyond ±20°. Rotation is per-word and may be regenerated on reload.
- Drift speed/direction: use the canonical HTML's existing physics. Do not modify.

### Rule 4 — Scene consistency and character handling

Each of the four rooms must feel like **a single cohesive world**: wall, floor, sticker pack, figure, song, lyrics, falling words — all tuned to the same palette and same emotional temperature. A room that mixes a library-style wall with a nightclub-style floor fails this rule.

The four rooms DO NOT have to be actual home rooms. Any four "small-room-like" spaces in the real world are valid:
- Library nook / bookshop aisle
- Supermarket produce section / convenience store
- Park bench area / rooftop garden
- Bus seat / subway car corner
- Café window seat / boba-shop
- Studio / dance classroom / art room
- Car interior / boat cabin

Constraint: the scene must feel **enclosed enough to read as a small space**. Open landscapes (a mountain vista, a beach) don't work — they break the diorama idea.

Picking the 4 scenes: if the user's intake material suggests four different places that were meaningful in the relationship, map each scene onto one of those places. The original scene IDs (`kitchen`/`rooftop`/`karaoke`/`couch`) stay fixed because they are referenced throughout the HTML — only the visual theming changes. Think of them as stable slot keys, not content.

Per-room figure rules:
- 1 or 2 figures per room. The canonical rooftop has 2; the others have 1. You MAY adjust to 1-2 based on the room's emotional beat.
- **Cutout + white outline** for all direct user photos (`scripts/stylize-character.sh`). Keep only the core person; trim aggressive backgrounds, clothing that bleeds into environment, etc.
- Some foreground decoration stickers may intentionally **occlude** parts of the figure — this is the correct depth trick and makes the diorama feel layered.
- If a chosen sticker is a photo frame, picture frame, calendar with a photo window, a polaroid, a TV screen, or any container meant to hold content: you MUST add an inner-content sticker on top of it. Empty frames are forbidden.

### Rule 5 — The four rooms' physical geometry

The four rooms are arranged in a 3D cross sharing the origin corner:
- `WALL_LEN = 2.5` — length of each radial wall from origin to outer edge
- `WALL_H = 2.4` — wall height
- `WALL_THK = 0.04` — wall thickness
- Room centers: kitchen `(-3.55, 1.35, 0)`, rooftop `(3.55, 1.35, 0)`, karaoke `(-3.55, -1.45, 0)`, couch `(3.55, -1.45, 0)`
- Each room's INNER corner is the same point. Adjacent rooms share their common wall.

**Do not alter any of these values.** The camera logic, snap angles, sticker coordinate system, lyric layout, particle system all assume this geometry. Any change cascades unpredictably.

### Rule 6 — Songs and lyric composition (copyright-safe)

Per-room song selection:
- Input to the AI: scene mood + user memories + (optional) user-specified song for this scene. If the user supplied a specific song, use it. Otherwise AI picks based on emotional match.
- Resolution: query iTunes Search API: `https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=<title>+<artist>&entity=song&limit=5`. No auth key required.
- Embed into HTML: the song's `trackName`, `artistName`, and `previewUrl` (the 30-second m4a) — exactly as the canonical `ROOMS[].song` object.

Copyright safety:
- Only the Apple-hosted 30-second preview URL is embedded. Do NOT download-and-rehost that audio.
- Lyrics written into the HTML are NOT the song's original lyrics. They are the user's own narrator-voice reflections composed by the AI.
- A single short phrase (**up to ~12 CJK chars or ~5 English words**) MAY be lightly quoted from the song in a form like: `[Artist]'s "[Song Title]" has that tiny phrase, "quoted phrase"`. This is a fair-use-sized quotation; the rest of the sentence (~95%) must be original text grounded in the user's memories.
- NEVER generate full verses, full choruses, or paraphrase multiple consecutive lines of any copyrighted song. NEVER output anything that reads as a translation or close paraphrase of a copyrighted lyric block.
- The two sentences per scene should each be ~80-140 CJK chars (proportional in other languages). They should feel like the user speaking about the moment, not like song lyrics reprinted.

### Rule 7 — Background particles

The canonical HTML has four layered starfield systems drifting slowly behind the rooms:

| Layer | Count | Radius | Size | Opacity | Color | y-bias |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1300 | 16-30 | 0.9 | 0.66 | `0xfff7dd` | 0.1 |
| 2 | 920 | 10-19 | 0.72 | 0.56 | `0xffd39a` | -0.15 |
| 3 | 680 | 12-24 | 1.05 | 0.34 | `0xffb47e` | -0.8 |
| 4 | 140 (clustered) | — | 0.65 | 0.10 | `0xffe1a8` | — |

These are clearly visible, warm, and well-distributed — they carry atmosphere between rooms during camera snaps. **Do not reduce density or dim them.** They are part of the template's visual identity.

### Rule 8 — Local dependencies the agent installs on demand

The build pipeline relies on:

- **Python 3.9+** (macOS default works)
- A local virtualenv: `python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
- pip packages:
  - Character cutout: `rembg onnxruntime Pillow opencv-python numpy`
  - Story-card generation (via litellm): `requests urllib3 Pillow`
  - Image processing (white outline, crop): `Pillow`
- rembg model: `isnet-general-use` (~170MB). rembg auto-downloads this to `~/.u2net` on first run.

The agent should install these ON DEMAND when a step that needs them is about to run — do not install upfront. For example:
- Only download rembg when the user actually provides photos needing cutout.
- Only install litellm/requests stack when generating story cards.

Tell the user what's about to be installed (one brief line) before running pip, so they can interrupt if they'd rather not touch their local env. Prefer running inside a fresh `.venv` at `./gifts/<date>-<recipient-slug>/.venv/` scoped to this one gift so nothing pollutes the user's globals.

## 2. Content Organization Principles

These rules govern the **content layer**: activation, intake, lyrics, falling words, story cards, and how much emotional interpretation is allowed. They are as important as the visual rules above.

### 2.1 Activation copy is a reference, not a fixed script

When the user activates `paper-house`, the agent may show a lively, warm prompt explaining what material works best. The wording below is a **style reference** only — adapt it to the user's language, energy, and normal speaking style. Do not paste it mechanically.

Reference shape:

> 🏠 We're going to turn this into a little paper house: four small rooms, each holding one memory of the recipient. Every room gets a 30-second song preview, one or two lines written in your voice, falling words, and a clickable object that opens a memory card.
>
> Lowest-friction version: put anything you have into one folder — photos, chat screenshots, a few story fragments, song names, voice notes transcribed into text — and send me the path. I'll sort through it.
>
> If you want the strongest version, add: 3+ clear photos of the recipient, around 4 concrete story fragments, music/artists/lyrics that matter to you both, and any catchphrases, nicknames, or inside jokes. If you don't have all that, no problem; we can start from what you have.

Rules:
- Tone may include emoji / kaomoji when it matches the user, but must not feel like a fixed marketing blurb.
- Keep the user moving. The activation message should reduce anxiety, not become a long questionnaire.
- Always offer the lowest-friction path: "put everything into one folder and send me the path".

### 2.2 Recommended material for best results

The template can start from very little, but the agent should know what "enough" looks like.

**Minimum viable material**:
- 1 recipient identity / relationship description
- 1-2 usable photos OR enough text context to generate non-specific figures
- 4 small story fragments (one per room), even if each is only one sentence

**Strong material**:
- 7-10 images total:
  - 3-5 clear recipient face / body references
  - 2-4 scene / object / shared-memory photos
  - optionally 1-2 photos of the user if both people appear in the gift
- 8-12 small stories or fragments:
  - 4 become room anchors
  - 4 become clickable card memories / falling words / background callbacks
- 1-4 music hints:
  - favorite artists
  - songs with shared meaning
  - genre/mood preferences
  - one short lyric phrase that matters (optional)
- 1-3 identity-confirmation details:
  - nickname
  - catchphrase / distinctive phrase
  - inside joke
  - repeated small habit
  - a phrase TA actually said

The agent should not demand all of this upfront. It should present it as "more material makes the gift better" while preserving the option to start immediately.

### 2.3 Clarifying questions: max 2, then proceed

If material is missing, ask at most **two** clarifying questions before slot matching. The exact wording is flexible.

Useful triggers:

| Missing / weak material | Ask, adapted to user's tone |
|---|---|
| Recipient photos < 2 | "The recipient photos are a bit thin. Want to add a few clear face / half-body shots? It helps keep them looking like the same person across all four rooms. Totally fine if not." |
| Fewer than 4 concrete story fragments | "This template works best when each room has its own small memory. Do you have around four little moments — one or two sentences each? If not, I can split what you already gave me." |
| No music clue | "Each room gets a 30-second song preview. Is there a song, artist, or genre that feels like them / like the two of you? If not, I'll choose." |
| No language habit / inside joke | "Do they have a catchphrase, nickname, or tiny inside joke only you two understand? Those details make the gift feel unmistakably theirs. No pressure if nothing comes to mind." |

Never ask a third intake question. After two questions, proceed to fill preview.

### 2.4 Match the user's normal language style

All written content should sound like an amplified version of the user's own way of expressing care, not like a generic romantic writer.

Check the user's intake:
- Do they write casually with "lol", "haha", slang, emoji, or short fragments? Use a casual register.
- Do they write quietly and minimally? Keep the gift restrained.
- Do they mix Chinese and English? Use the same mix only where natural.
- Do they call the recipient "mom", "mama", "Xiao A", "Ren", "baby", a nickname, or an inside-joke name? Use the user's actual address form consistently.

If the user's natural style is plain, do not force ornate metaphors. If the user's material is playful, do not over-solemnize it.

### 2.5 Factuality: no invented facts

This template is allowed to **describe atmosphere**, not invent facts.

Allowed:
- Expand a true detail with sensory texture: user said "we cooked tomato pasta" → write about steam, tomato smell, warm kitchen light.
- Infer a light emotional reading from visible evidence: user said the recipient laughed in a karaoke room → "the second you laughed mid-song".
- Use a scene object as metaphor when grounded in the memory.

Forbidden:
- Invent dates, places, songs, nicknames, medical facts, family history, personality traits, relationship milestones, or exact quotes.
- Put words in the recipient's mouth unless the user provided them.
- Create a story-card around an event that never appeared in the intake.
- Overstate certainty: "you must have been exhausted", "mom will definitely understand", "that was the most important night of your relationship".

When uncertain, use softer language or shrink the claim. A small true card beats a lush false one.

### 2.6 No emotional over-rendering

Do not make the gift more dramatic, romantic, or tearful than the material supports.

Avoid:
- Excessive vows, forever-language, destiny-language, or "the whole world disappeared and only we remained" unless the user's own style already talks like this.
- Calling every minor moment "the most precious thing", "unforgettable for a lifetime", or "destined".
- Making a parent/friend/coworker gift sound like a love confession.
- Turning ordinary warmth into melodrama.

The best paper-house writing often feels like: **specific, low voice, emotionally accurate**. It can be tender without becoming sticky or melodramatic.

### 2.7 Identity-confirmation point

Each gift should include at least one detail that makes the recipient think: "oh, this was made for me, not for anyone else."

Good identity-confirmation details:
- A real nickname
- A real catchphrase
- An inside joke
- A tiny repeated habit
- A detail from a photo only this person would recognize
- A specific object or place the recipient knows
- A user's exact remembered phrasing

Place at least one such point in either:
- one of the 4 story-card texts, or
- the first room's lyric-prose, or
- a falling-word cluster that repeats visually.

If none exists in the material, ask one of the two allowed clarifying questions. If the user doesn't provide one, proceed with a lighter gift and do not invent.

### 2.8 Rhythm and density

Paper-house is a slow-reading gift. The viewer needs room to look around.

Rules:
- One room should not carry all the emotional weight. Spread meaning across the 4 rooms.
- Each room should have one core memory, not three competing memories.
- Card text: usually 60-110 CJK chars. If the true material is thin, 30-50 chars is acceptable. Do not pad.
- Lyric-prose: 2 long sentences per room, but not every sentence must max out. Let lines breathe.
- Falling words: enough to feel rich, not enough to become visual noise.

If a room feels crowded, remove content before adding polish.

### 2.9 One memory, one layer

The same memory should not be repeated in every text layer.

Each room has three text layers:
1. lyric-prose
2. falling words
3. clickable card text

A memory can dominate ONE layer and echo lightly in another, but it should not be fully retold in all three.

Example:
- If "tomato pasta" is the kitchen card's main story, the lyric-prose may mention "warm kitchen light" and "you turned back to ask if it was salty enough", while the falling words include "passed the bowl" — but don't repeat "tomato pasta" everywhere.

This creates discovery: the recipient sees a new detail at every depth.

## 4. Per-Gift Production Checklist

When the user picks `paper-house`, walk through these steps in order. Slot Matching (Stage 0.5 in the main flow) covers steps 2-8. Read both **Production Rules** and **Content Organization Principles** before writing the fill preview.

### Activation disclosure

Before fetching assets, installing dependencies, querying music, or generating images, tell the user briefly:

> 这个模板效果会比较完整，但第一次会下载约 150MB 素材；如果要生成专属人物/故事卡，还需要图片生成能力。没有也能做轻量版。

Offer exactly these choices:

1. **full version** — download the asset bundle, use available image generation for walls / figures / story cards, resolve songs through iTunes Search, and build the complete interactive H5.
2. **lightweight draft version** — use cached or draft assets where possible, allow story-card placeholders, skip missing image APIs without blocking, and still produce a previewable H5.
3. **text/image fallback** — skip the heavy H5 path and make a sendable image or text gift from the same recipient brief.

Only proceed with the heavy steps after the user accepts full version or lightweight draft version. If they choose text/image fallback, leave `paper-house` template mode and use the normal image/text path.

**1. Ensure `base/` is present.** If missing and the user chose full version or lightweight draft version, run:
```
scripts/fetch-asset-bundle.sh --template paper-house
```

**2. Decide scene themes** (Rule 4). For each of the 4 scene IDs, pick a re-themed scene if the user's context strongly suggests different places; otherwise keep the original kitchen/rooftop/karaoke/couch. Write the `theme`, `eyebrow`, `note`, and `palette` for each room. Palettes should preserve the contrast structure of the canonical ROOMS[].palette (bg / wall2 / floor / ink / accent / glow / figureA / figureB).

**3. Resolve 4 songs** (Rule 6). For each scene, choose a song (user-provided or AI-picked), query iTunes Search API, grab `previewUrl`, `trackName`, `artistName`.

**4. Compose lyrics + falling words** (Rules 3, 6; Content Principles 2.4-2.9). Per scene: 2 narrator-voice sentences, each containing at most one short (~12 char) song-quote and grounded in specific user material. Then 22-28 falling-word phrases, 60% specific and 40% mood, each a complete short phrase. Match the user's normal language style; do not invent facts or over-romanticize thin material.

**5. Pick hero items + decoration stickers** (Rule 4). Per scene: exactly 1 hero sticker (kitchen_4 fridge, rooftop_1 suitcase, karaoke_3 camera, couch_6 chess are the canonical slots — pick different sticker numbers or different categories if user memories clearly point elsewhere). Then 5-7 supporting decoration stickers, occlusion-friendly, picked from appropriate categories based on the room's theme and user context.

**6. Generate walls + floor** (Rule 2). For each scene, generate left wall, right wall, floor as ONE consistency group. Follow the style anchor from `base/reference/scene_{scene_id}.jpg` for palette and mood. Enforce the flat-wall-content rule.

**7. Generate figure sprites + story cards** (Rules 2, 4). 
- For character identity: if the user supplied usable photos, resolve the optional `character_reference` slot first by running them through `scripts/stylize-character.sh` into `paper-house-work/character_reference/{n}.png`; if no photo is available, document in the fill preview that figures will be consistent but non-specific.
- For `scene_figure_image`: generate the final per-room sprite(s) into `paper-house-work/figures/scene_{scene_id}.png` and numbered variants, using `character_reference` as identity input when available or a consistent non-specific protagonist when not.
- For story cards: copy `template-source/story_cards/prompts/story_card_image_prompts.json` to `paper-house-work/story_cards/prompts/story_card_image_prompts.json`, rewrite each card's prompt with the per-gift hero object, room palette, protagonist identity, and 2-3 supporting sticker references, then run:
  ```
  python3 assets/templates/paper-house/template-source/scripts/generate_story_cards_litellm.py \
    --prompts ./gifts/<slug>/paper-house-work/story_cards/prompts/story_card_image_prompts.json \
    --workdir ./gifts/<slug>/paper-house-work \
    --outdir ./gifts/<slug>/paper-house-work/story_cards/generated \
    --provider auto
  ```
  Provider auto-selection prefers `GEMINI_API_KEY` with `GEMINI_IMAGE_MODEL` (default `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview`), then `LITELLM_BASE_URL` + `LITELLM_API_KEY` with `LITELLM_IMAGE_MODEL` (default `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview`), then `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` with `OPENROUTER_IMAGE_MODEL` (default `google/gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview`). If no provider is configured, or if generation fails without `--strict`, the script writes 1024x720 draft story-card placeholders so the gift can still build. Only use `--insecure-skip-verify` when the user explicitly accepts skipping TLS verification.

**8. Compose card text + decals** (Rule 1, Content Principles 2.4-2.9, and `references/gifting-ethics.md`). Per card: title, kicker, paper/accent hex colors matching the room palette, 3-4 overlay decals (stickers with x/y/w/r positioning), and a handwritten memory text of 60-110 CJK chars (or the equivalent in the user's language) grounded in a specific detail from the user's intake. At least one card or lyric must contain an identity-confirmation point (nickname, catchphrase, inside joke, exact phrase, specific object/place) when the user supplied one. Pick ONE layout per card from the four options (note / split / diagonal / triangle).

**9. Assemble `filled-slots.json` + run `build.py`**. The builder treats `template-source/night-four-the-turn.html` as read-only, applies runtime slot values, and writes the final single-file HTML to the gift folder:
```
python3 assets/templates/paper-house/template-source/build.py \
  --slots ./gifts/<slug>/paper-house-work/filled-slots.json \
  --workdir ./gifts/<slug>/paper-house-work \
  --out ./gifts/<slug>/index.html
```
Supported runtime slot groups in this version:
- Native template slots: `scene_theme`, `character_reference`, `room_walls_and_floor`, `scene_figure_image`, `scene_decorations`, `scene_hero_items`, `story_cards`, `scene_song`, `scene_lyrics`, `scene_fall_words`
- Compatibility groups: `rooms`, `images`, `stories`
- `rooms`: per-room `title`, `eyebrow`, `note`, `palette`, `lyricColor`, `lyricShadow`, `song`, `lyrics`, `fallWords`
- `images`: HTML image-data keys such as `scene_kitchen`, `kitchen_left`, `kitchen_right`, `kitchen_floor`, `kitchen_1` mapped to workdir asset paths or data URIs
- `stories`: hotspot IDs such as `kitchen_4` mapped to card `item`, `title`, `kicker`, `image`, `layout`, `paper`, `accent`, `decals`, `text`

Native slot mapping notes:
- `scene_theme.<scene>.theme` becomes the room title unless `title` is provided.
- `character_reference` is used during slot matching and asset generation only; the current builder does not need to read it directly.
- `room_walls_and_floor.<scene>.wall_left/wall_right/floor` maps to `{scene}_left`, `{scene}_right`, `{scene}_floor` image keys. If a component value is omitted or empty, the builder reads `walls/{scene}_left.jpg`, `walls/{scene}_right.jpg`, or `floors/{scene}_floor.jpg` from `--workdir`.
- `scene_figure_image.<scene>` maps to `scene_{scene}`; additional list entries map to `scene_{scene}_2`, `scene_{scene}_3`, etc. Empty object/list entries default to `figures/scene_{scene}.png` and numbered variants.
- `scene_decorations.<scene>` fills the existing six decoration image keys `{scene}_1..{scene}_6`; omitted/empty entries default to `stickers/{scene}/1.png` through `stickers/{scene}/6.png`. More than six items fails clearly because the current 3D layout only has six positions per room.
- `scene_hero_items.<scene>` targets the default hotspot for that scene unless `hotspot_id` is provided.
- `story_cards.<scene>` targets the default hotspot image for that scene unless keyed by explicit hotspot id. Empty objects default to `story_cards/generated/{scene}-{item}.png`.

The builder exits with a clear error if a referenced asset path, room id, hotspot id, image key, or supported field is missing/unknown. It must never modify any file under `template-source/`.

**10. Deliver.** Either open locally or push via `scripts/deliver-gift.sh --domain <surge-subdomain>`.

## 5. Dependencies — Installation on Demand

The agent should NOT pre-install anything. When a step needs a dependency:

1. Tell the user in one brief line: `I need to install rembg for character cutout (~180MB model), then I'll continue`.
2. Create (or activate) a local venv scoped to this gift: `python3 -m venv ./gifts/<slug>/.venv && source ./gifts/<slug>/.venv/bin/activate`.
3. `pip install <packages>`.
4. Run the step.

Dependency groups:

| When | Install |
|---|---|
| First cutout of a user photo | `rembg onnxruntime Pillow opencv-python numpy` |
| First story-card generation | `requests Pillow` |
| White-outline post-process | `Pillow` (usually already present) |

The isnet-general-use rembg model (~170MB) downloads automatically on first call. Tell the user to expect a ~1 min delay the first time.

## 6. Failure Modes and Fallbacks

- **No reference photo of the recipient**: generate 4 consistent-but-non-specific figures across all rooms. Document this explicitly to the user in the fill preview.
- **iTunes search fails for a chosen song**: fall back to the user's specified song, or if they specified nothing, AI picks a different song with the same mood and re-queries.
- **Image generation fails mid-flight**: retry once with a slightly relaxed prompt, then fall back to a lightweight composition — never deliver a gift with a missing wall/floor/story-card.
- **Story-card image API unavailable**: run `generate_story_cards_litellm.py --provider auto`; it will write draft story-card placeholders when no Gemini, LiteLLM, or OpenRouter credentials are configured. Use `--strict` only when missing/generated placeholders should block the build.
- **Hero sticker user-suggested has no physical fit with the canonical layout slot**: keep the user's sticker choice but re-place it at a reasonable coordinate within the DECOR_LAYOUT schema rather than forcing a bad slot.
- **User's lyric request would require large copyrighted quotation**: respond honestly — offer the same emotional beat written as original text with a ≤12-char quoted phrase, or offer a different song whose already-quotable phrase matches.

---

## 7. What NOT to Do

- Do not modify `template-source/night-four-the-turn.html` or any of the `patch_*.py` files. They are frozen golden references.
- Do not bundle generated user content (photos, memories, names) into the skill — it always stays in the user's gift folder, locally.
- Do not add new sticker categories to the bundled library in a way that isn't versioned via GitHub Release. If you add stickers during a gift run, save them to the user's gift folder, not to the skill install.
- Do not quote more than ~12 chars of any copyrighted song.
- Do not generate walls/floors that depict a 3D receding room.
- Do not generate figures that don't resemble the recipient when a reference photo was provided.
- Do not render empty photo frames / empty content containers.
- Do not promise outputs that rely on models or keys the user hasn't set up. Before generation steps, verify keys and give a clean fallback if missing.
