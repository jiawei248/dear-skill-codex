# Diary Scrapbook Template Notes

A wide-format open diary with deep steel blue (#345b82) pages. Left page features a scrapbook-style collage with overlapping photos (vintage maps, Polaroid-style frames, push-pins), sparkle stars, gingham-pattern hearts, and stickers. Right page has handwritten-style diary text (Caveat font) on ruled lines. Month tabs across the top and sidebar.

It implements a `memory-shelf` pattern: keepsake browsing through personal artifacts, collage, and handwritten reflections.

## Reference Use

Treat as reference. Codex may change the photos, stickers, text, and color theme. The core idea: an intimate scrapbook diary that feels handmade, personal, and warm.

## What To Change Per Use

- document.title
- Diary text content
- Photo/image content in collage
- Sticker and decorative elements
- Page color theme
- Month tab labels
- Handwriting font choice

## What Not To Copy Blindly

- the exact steel blue color
- the specific Arabic calligraphy elements
- the exact sticker/star placement

## Best Fit

- personal memory compilations
- "letter to you" gifts
- anniversary or milestone scrapbooks
- reflective, intimate gifts
- travel memory journals
- deeply personal relationship gifts

## Watch Outs

- wide format needs landscape or horizontal scroll on mobile
- Caveat handwriting font may not render on all systems — use Google Fonts CDN
- many overlapping elements may cause z-index issues
- Polaroid frames need actual images — placeholder handling needed
- heavy decorative CSS — test performance on mobile
- do not use @latest or unstable external dependencies

## Delivery Note

Single HTML file. Google Fonts CDN is acceptable. Images should be inline base64 or generated.
