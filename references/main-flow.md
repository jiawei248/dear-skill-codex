# Main Flow

The complete flow for a single `$dear-codex` invocation, end to end. This replaces the original skill's separate manual-run, daily-run, and setup flows — there is no daily cron in Codex, and the skill is always user-triggered.

## Flow Overview

There are two paths. Both share intake and delivery; the middle differs.

### Creative path (default)

```
invocation
   ↓
Stage 0: Recipient & Moment Intake    → recipient-intake.md
   ↓
Stage 1: Editorial Judgment            → editorial-judgment.md
   ↓
Stage 2: Synthesis + Gift Thesis       → creative-concept.md (first half)
   ↓
Stage 2.5: Creative Concept            → creative-concept.md (second half)
   ↓
Format Selection gate                   → gift-format-chooser.md
   ↓
Stage 3: Visual Strategy               → stage3-visual-strategy.md
   ↓
Stage 4: Visualization & Rendering     → stage4-visualization.md
   ↓
Delivery                                → delivery-rules.md
   ↓
(Optional) Append to ./gift-history.jsonl
```

### Template path

```
invocation with --template <id>  OR  user picks template after browse
   ↓
Stage 0: Recipient & Moment Intake    → recipient-intake.md
   ↓
Stage 0.5: Slot Matching               → templates.md
   ↓
Show fill preview to user
   ↓
Natural-language edit loop             → templates.md
   (user confirms or asks for changes; skill re-fills slots; re-show)
   ↓
Stage T: Template Build                 → templates.md (build pipeline)
   ↓
Delivery                                → delivery-rules.md
   ↓
(Optional) Append to ./gift-history.jsonl
```

Read each stage's reference file **just-in-time** when you reach that stage. Do not pre-load all references up front.

## Path Selection

At the start of every invocation, decide which path to follow:

- If the user explicitly named a template (`--template`, "用 X 模板", or picked one from a browse list) → **template path**
- If the user provided a concrete one-shot creative brief with no recipient ("画一张水彩...") → **visualization-only mode** (a sub-mode of the creative path; see below)
- Otherwise → **creative path**

During the creative path's Format Selection gate, the skill MAY check the template registry: if any template's `best_for` and `tone` strongly match the locked concept, the skill may offer to switch to that template. This is an offer, not a redirect — never override the user's chosen path silently.

## Progress Reporting

The user is present in Codex and actively waiting. They benefit from lightweight updates but should NOT see internal reasoning.

Rules:

- Send one brief warm message when gift creation starts ("在做你的礼物～" / "等我一下，有个小东西想给 TA~")
- If the process takes more than about 3 minutes, one optional patience message is allowed ("快好了～")
- Total user-visible messages around the gift should be at most 3: start + optional patience + delivery
- Do NOT reveal the specific concept, format choice, or internal reasoning before delivery
- Do NOT expose technical errors, retries, or self-test results
- The surprise is part of the gift — keep details hidden until delivery
- Delivery message: 1-2 sentences of emotional context about the gift (the "why", not the "how")

Bad progress examples (never do these):

- "创意确定：矛盾体质鉴定报告——体检报告格式，6项矛盾指标+温柔医生评语"
- "方案：H5（CSS模拟体检报告纸质感）"
- "部署失败，重试中"
- any technical details, error recovery, concept names, format decisions, or internal reasoning

Exception: if the user is explicitly debugging the skill ("帮我测试一下", "我要看看流程", "debug模式"), full verbose output is acceptable.

## Single Output Rule

Always deliver exactly ONE final gift to the user. 

Do not:

- generate multiple versions and ask the user to pick
- send two images "看看哪个好"
- offer A/B choices

If you want to self-check quality, do it internally. The user only sees the final chosen result.

Exception: explicit debug or test sessions.

## Real-Time Execution

Because the user is present, execute inline in the current Codex thread. Do not delegate the main gift workflow to subagents unless the user explicitly asks for parallel agents or delegation. If the user does ask for delegation, keep subtasks concrete and bounded, then integrate the result visibly in the main thread.

## Full Creative Workflow

Every `$dear-codex` invocation that isn't visualization-only AND isn't in template path follows the full six-stage pipeline:

1. Stage 0: Recipient & Moment Intake
2. Stage 1: Editorial Judgment
3. Stage 2: Synthesis + Gift Thesis
4. Stage 2.5: Creative Concept (5 candidates → select the best)
5. Format Selection
6. Stage 3: Visual Strategy
7. Stage 4: Render + Deliver

## Template Path Workflow

When the user picks a template:

1. **Stage 0**: standard intake — folder / brief / interactive — same as creative path. The template's own slot schema will guide how the material is interpreted.
2. **Load template manifest** at `{baseDir}/assets/templates/<id>/template.json`. Verify the asset bundle is present locally; if not, fetch from the manifest's `asset_bundle.url`.
3. **Stage 0.5 — Slot Matching**: walk through every slot declared in the manifest, fill it from intake material plus AI generation/composition as the slot type dictates. See `templates.md` for the per-slot-type algorithm.
4. **Fill preview**: render a markdown summary of every filled slot and show it to the user.
5. **Natural-language edit loop**: the user can say anything to adjust anything ("kitchen 的歌词换一首" / "整体感觉太冷了" / "Mia 的照片用另一张"). Skill re-fills affected slots and re-shows the preview. No structured commands. Loop continues until the user says "ok / 可以 / 开始做".
6. **Stage T — Build**: write `filled-slots.json`, run the template's `build_script`, capture the output `index.html`.
7. **Delivery**: same as creative path — drop into `./gifts/<date>-<recipient-slug>/`, optionally deploy via `deliver-gift.sh`.

Template path skips Stages 1, 2, 2.5, and Format Selection. The template ENCODES those decisions.

Stage 3 visual strategy is **partially active** in template mode — only for the per-gift `ai_generated_image` slots, where the skill must produce a coherent, scene-consistent image at the slot's required size. Use `stage3-visual-strategy.md` for guidance on those individual generations, but do NOT redo overall format/visual planning.

## Visualization-Only Mode

When the user invokes the skill with a concrete creative brief instead of a recipient context — e.g.:

```
$dear-codex 用水彩风画一张：雨天窗边看书的场景
$dear-codex 把这首诗做成一个有风吹散效果的H5
$dear-codex 生成一张氛围图：深夜台灯下改代码
```

— treat it as **visualization-only mode**. The user has already done the editorial and concept work themselves; the skill's job is execution, not ideation.

In this mode:

1. Skip Stage 0 intake Q&A. There is no recipient to learn about.
2. Skip Stage 1 editorial judgment. The user decided what to make.
3. Do a lightweight mini-synthesis from the user's brief only.
4. Infer format from the brief if possible: "水彩" / "插画" / "氛围图" / "表情包" → `image`; "H5" / "页面" / "互动" → `h5`; "诗" / "信" / "故事" → `text`. If unclear, default to whichever the brief sounds most like.
5. Run Stage 3 Visual Strategy with the full mandatory checklist.
6. Run the Pre-Visualization Check.
7. Run Stage 4 Visualization with the same visual quality floor as a full gift.
8. Deliver.

Visualization-only still:

- Follows the same visual quality floor
- Reads at least one relevant pattern card or genre reference
- Reads a relevant template when one exists
- Honors `html-spec.md` for H5 output and `image-integration.md` for image output

Visualization-only does NOT:

- Ask recipient questions
- Run the 5-candidate concept comparison (the user already picked)
- Append to `gift-history.jsonl` unless the user is also telling the skill who the gift is for

## No Format Downgrade Under Time Pressure

The skill is not allowed to downgrade the chosen format just because the user is waiting, the task feels slow, or a quicker path is available.

Do not do:

- "this should be h5, but image is faster so I'll switch"
- "this should be text, but I'll send a short image because I already have the prompt"
- "the user has waited 2 minutes, so I'll collapse the concept into a cheaper format"

Allowed reasons to change format mid-flight:

- the originally chosen format is genuinely unavailable (missing API key)
- the required capability fails and retry is no longer sensible
- a stricter format-fit check shows the original choice was wrong
- the user explicitly changes preference

If you must change format, preserve the same anchor-plus-return quality bar.

## Post-Delivery (Lightweight)

After the gift is delivered:

1. Write the gift artifact(s) to `./gifts/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<recipient-slug>/`
2. (Optional, recommended) Append a single line to `./gift-history.jsonl` with the gift's metadata — see `gift-history.schema.json`
3. If the artifact is H5 and the user has a hosting domain configured, run `scripts/deliver-gift.sh` and surface the returned URL

That is the complete post-delivery. There is no cron-based reflection, no long-term memory update, no taste-profile heartbeat. Those belonged to the daemon-style original skill and have no equivalent in Codex.

If the user wants to capture anything about how this went for future reference, they can ask explicitly — don't do it silently.
